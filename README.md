# Tokenization Gifting
Project for ETHGlobal's MarketMake 2021. 

This project tokenizes gold assets that can be used within DeFi. To show the application of depositing an asset, the application stakes the funds and pays out the interest to Givith.io.

 [1] A securities asset tokenization application that utilizes the asset value on the Aave protocol for use in other applicable Aave features.
 
 [2] Apply the securities asset to interest bearing account and automatically donate interest to Giveth.io. 


# Project Checklist / ToDo

[1] Asset Tokenization Smart Contract

    [1.1] ERC20 Token Smart Contract, value pegged to gold.
    
    [1.2] Connect ERC20 Token Smart Contract to Aave protocol, lending pool
    
[2] Kovan TestNet

    [2.1] Deploy smart contracts to Kovan (Infura.io)
    
    [2.2] Link client to Koven
    
[3] Gifting Methodology

    [3.1] Connect client to interest baring account (Aave account / tokens) 
    
    [3.2] Automatic transfers from Aave interest account to Givith.io



# Hardhat Hackathon Boilerplate

This repository contains a sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's also a great fit for learning the basics of
smart contract development.

This project is intended to be used with the
[Hardhat Beginners Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial), but you should be
able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its
`contracts`, `tests`, `scripts` and `frontend` directories.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate.git
cd hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail.
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## User Guide

You can find detailed instructions on using this repository and many tips in [its documentation](https://hardhat.org/tutorial).

- [Project description (Token.sol)](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/4-contracts/)
- [Setting up the environment](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/1-setup/)
- [Testing with Hardhat, Mocha and Waffle](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/5-test/)
- [Setting up Metamask](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/8-frontend/#setting-up-metamask)
- [Hardhat's full documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)

For a complete introduction to Hardhat, refer to [this guide](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview).

## Whatâ€™s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a Dapp powered by Hardhat and React.

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): An Ethereum development task runner and testing network.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): A JavaScript test runner.
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): A JavaScript assertion library.
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/): A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
- [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/): To have Ethereum-specific Chai assertions/mathers.
- [A sample frontend/Dapp](./frontend): A Dapp which uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Troubleshooting

- `Invalid nonce` errors: if you are seeing this error on the `npx hardhat node`
  console, try resetting your Metamask account. This will reset the account's
  transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account
  followed by `Settings > Advanced > Reset Account`.
